/**
 * The `consul.getServices` data source returns a list of Consul services that
 * have been registered with the Consul cluster in a given datacenter.  By
 * specifying a different datacenter in the `queryOptions` it is possible to
 * retrieve a list of services from a different WAN-attached Consul datacenter.
 *
 * This data source is different from the `consul.Service` (singular) data
 * source, which provides a detailed response about a specific Consul service.
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as consul from "@pulumi/consul";
 * import * as example from "@pulumi/example";
 * import * as std from "@pulumi/std";
 *
 * const read_dc1 = consul.getServices({
 *     queryOptions: [{
 *         datacenter: "dc1",
 *     }],
 * });
 * // Set the description to a whitespace delimited list of the services
 * const app = new example.index.Resource("app", {description: std.join({
 *     separator: " ",
 *     input: names,
 * }).result});
 * ```
